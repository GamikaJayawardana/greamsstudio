With such a small pool of applicants to choose from, these two sectors are battling to get the most qualified available candidates. Many pilots are increasingly being wooed to get behind the controls of passenger planes over cargo flights\u2014frankly, it\u2019s tough to compete with jobs perks like fixed schedules and free flights for your family across the world.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Thousands of successful projects we are one of the most trusted construction companies<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is no anecdotal pilot shortage, either\u2014the same problems are found on a global scale, with Boeing estimating an incredible shortage of 790,000 or more pilots across the world over the next two decades. In the shorter term, the domestic industry can expect more than\u00a08,000 unfilled vacancies per year by 2020, and five years later that number could be higher than 12,000 pilot-less flights in need of help. This spells trouble for your supply chain because even if you don\u2019t personally rely on flight to get items delivered, chances are at least one of your key suppliers does.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"checked-list mb-3\">\n<li>We track every dollar<\/li>\n<li>We\u2019re an open book<\/li>\n<li>100% goes to the field<\/li>\n<li>Received the highest grades<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Investing in Freight Broker Training<\/h3>\n<p>Just as we\u2019ve found with the truck driver shortage, the impetus behind skilled labor leaving is many-fold. Demographics play a large role\u2014a massive amount of pilots are expected to hang up their hats in the next few years as they reach the mandatory commercial pilot retirement age of 65. And there\u2019s no large group of applicants sitting waiting to replace them.This is likely because it\u2019s becoming considerably more difficult to obtain a pilot license than it was ten years ago.\u00a0<strong>After a 2009 Colgan Air crash, the US Federal Aviation Administration raised the requirements for an ATP certificate from 250 hours to a whopping 1,500 hours of training.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have a proven record of best result of building and reputable company in the United States.
